# Simplify Path

## Problem Description

Given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which begins with a slash '/', transform this path into its simplified canonical path.

In Unix-style file system context:
- A single period `'.'` signifies the current directory.
- A double period `'..'` denotes moving up one directory level.
- Multiple slashes such as `'//'` are interpreted as a single slash.

In this problem, treat sequences of periods not covered by the previous rules (like `'...'`) as valid names for files or directories.

The simplified canonical path should adhere to the following rules:
- It must start with a single slash `'/'`.
- Directories within the path should be separated by only one slash `'/'`.
- It should not end with a slash `'/'`, unless it's the root directory.
- It should exclude any single or double periods used to denote current or parent directories.

Return the new path.

## Examples

### Example 1
- **Input:** `path = "/home/"`
- **Output:** `"/home"`
- **Explanation:** The trailing slash should be removed.

### Example 2
- **Input:** `path = "/home//foo/"`
- **Output:** `"/home/foo"`
- **Explanation:** Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

### Example 3
- **Input:** `path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"`
- **Output:** `"/home/user/Pictures"`
- **Explanation:** A double period `..` refers to the directory up a level.

### Example 4
- **Input:** `path = "/../"`
- **Output:** `"/"`
- **Explanation:** Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

### Example 5
- **Input:** `path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"`
- **Output:** `"/.../b/d"`
- **Explanation:** `"..."` is a valid name for a directory in this problem.

## Constraints
- `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
- `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or underscore `'_'`.
- `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a stack to process the components of the path. We split the path by slashes, and then process each component:
- If the component is `'.'` or an empty string, we ignore it.
- If the component is `'..'`, we pop from the stack if it's not empty.
- Otherwise, we push the component onto the stack.

Finally, we join the components in the stack with slashes to form the simplified canonical path.

### Steps:
1. Split the input `path` by `'/'`.
2. Initialize an empty stack.
3. Iterate through each component in the split path:
   - Ignore empty strings and `'.'`.
   - If the component is `'..'`, pop the stack if it's not empty.
   - Otherwise, push the component onto the stack.
4. Join the stack with slashes to form the canonical path.
5. Return `'/'` if the stack is empty; otherwise, return the joined path.

### Example Code (Python):
```python
def simplifyPath(path: str) -> str:
    components = path.split('/')
    stack = []
    
    for component in components:
        if component == '' or component == '.':
            continue
        elif component == '..':
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(component)
    
    return '/' + '/'.join(stack)

# Testing
print(simplifyPath("/home/"))           # Output: "/home"
print(simplifyPath("/home//foo/"))      # Output: "/home/foo"
print(simplifyPath("/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"))  # Output: "/home/user/Pictures"
print(simplifyPath("/../"))             # Output: "/"
print(simplifyPath("/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"))  # Output: "/.../b/d"
